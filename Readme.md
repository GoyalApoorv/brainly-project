2.  **Install Backend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your backend folder
    cd backend 
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Backend Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    DATABASE_URL="your_mongodb_connection_string"
    JWT_PASSWORD="your_super_secret_jwt_password"
    PORT=3000
    ```

4.  **Install Frontend Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to your frontend folder from the root
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```

5.  **Configure Frontend Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the following:

### Running the Application

You will need two separate terminals to run both the frontend and backend servers.

1.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /backend directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The server should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /frontend directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
